## Objectives
- Proving things with the use of  AI in math
- Finding contradictions with the use of AI

## Questions
1. Show that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.
2. Prove that there is no positive integer $n$ such that $n^2 + n^3 = 100$. 
3. Show that the proposition `P → (Q → (P → Q))` is not logically equivalent to `((P → Q) → P ) → Q` 
   1. by using truth tables.
   2. by using inference rules.
4. Prove/disprove that every positive integer can be written as a sum of two primes.
5. 6. **sudoku puzzle:** If there is an assignment of truth values that makes a compound proposition true, then it is called **satisfiable**.
   1.  Write sudoku puzzle as a satisfiability problem.(Given in the book, after example 9 in Chapter 1.3) 
   2. Show that Sudoku can be solved by using backtracking 
      1. explain its difference to exhaustive search
   3. Prove/disprove that every Sudoku problem written as satisfiability has at least one solution.
6. **N-queens satisfiability problem:**
   1. Write the following problem in CNF formula: `How can N queens be placed on an NxN chessboard so that no two of them attack each other? (take N = 2 or N =4 ).
   2. Show that it can be solved by using backtracking and exhaustive search.
   3. Prove/disprove that it has at least one solution.
7. Show that we can tile an 8x8 checkerboard by using straight triominoes.
   1. First ask AI to define triominoes
   2. Then use colors to show that if it is possible.
8.  Ask AI to find a contradiction in law/regulations related to anything in Turkey or any other country that is currently used. It may be regulations in university or sports (Only exception is politics).
   1. In particular you can ask AI to find premises and assumptions that leads to contradictory conclusions. 
   2. In this question, you can particularly direct AI to a field.

**- For each question, you should verify the answers, if they are not correct, you should correct them or get AI correct them. And explain your reasons.**

## Submission
You should put your answers in text by formatting using markdown or html in canvas.
Do not put links.

## Grading Rubric
The homework is peer graded.

- Each question is 10 points. For each question, the grading is as follows:
  - 0 missing answers
  - 5 insufficient or not totally related answer (unchecked AI output etc.)
  - 8 sufficient but not enough 
- **+20 points for peer reviewing**
