# 📚 Course Content  

This course teaches discrete mathematics that is used in Computer Science.
- The basic understanding of what mathematics is and how mathematical definitions and proofs work.

## 📖 Primary Resources
  - **textbook:** Discrete mathematics and its applications, Seventh Edition Kenneth H. Rosen.  
  * [Notes on Discrete Mathematics by James Aspnes](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/classes/202/notes.pdf)
  * And DeepSeek

## 🤔 So why do I need to learn all this nasty mathematics?
  <div class="fragment">
    <pre><code>
  Computation = {
    abstract: true,
    intangible: true, //you can't see or touch
    governedBy: "strict, well-defined rules",
    scale: "too big to comprehend all at once"
  }
</code></pre>
</div>

---

## 🔍 To understand computation, we need:

- **formal a language** that allows us to reason about things
  - we can’t see and can’t touch, 
  - that are too big for us to understand, but that nonetheless follow strict, simple, well-defined rules.
- **Tools** to manage complexity  

---

## But, isn’t math hard?  
- even apparently simple things like learning how to count or add require years of training

### 🧠 Your Brain on Rules  
Cognitive Challenge: [ Wason Selection Task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wason_selection_task): 
 "Which cards must you flip to verify: **Even number ⇒ Blue back?**"

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px; justify-content: center; background-color: green;">
  <div style="border: 2px solid black; width: 80px; 
  height: 120px; padding: 10px; text-align: center; background: #ff4444;">
    <span style="font-size: 32px;color:white;"> red </span>
  </div>
  <div style="border: 2px solid black; width: 80px; height: 120px; padding: 10px; text-align: center; background: #3b5998;"\>
    <span style="font-size: 32px;color: white;"> blue </span>
  </div>
  <div style="border: 2px solid black; width: 80px; height: 120px; padding: 10px; text-align: center; background: white;"\>
    <span style="font-size: 64px;color:black;">4</span>
  </div>
  <div style="border: 2px solid black; width: 80px; height: 120px; padding: 10px; text-align: center; background: white;"\>
    <span style="font-size: 64px;color:black;">7</span>
  </div>
</div>  


- Abstract cards (e.g., numbers/letters) → Most get it wrong 😬
- Social rules (e.g., "voting in an election? Must be 18+!") → Most nail it 🎯

#### ⚖️ Math vs. Legal Reasoning: Same DNA

| ➜ 1. Math Induction |  👑 2. Royal Bloodline Rules|    
|-----------------|------------------------|  
If $x$ is in $S$, then $x + 1$ is in $S$. | If $x$ is of royal blood, then $x$’s child is of royal blood.  
*Builds infinite sets*| *Builds dynasties*   

- So why is statement (1) trickier to think about than statement (2)?
 - mathematical reasoning is very close to legal reasoning, which we do seem to be very good at.

---

#### How to get better at math?

- **Mathematical maturity:** Learn the language (abstract concepts)
- **Motivation:** Activate the part of your brain that are good at mathematics
  - Imagine you are trying to stop your worst enemy to steal your prize
  - you need to be fully engaged

**The Math Behind Tech 🔐⚡**

💡 **Key Insight:**
Computers are discrete mathematical objects. 
Their behavior is entirely governed by rules defined using logic, sets, functions, and combinatorics.

---

🔍 **The Wason Task Revisited:**
Humans struggle with abstract logical rules; but AI systems thrive on them. 
Discrete math gives machines their "rigor" advantage.  

---

**Fun fact:** A single GPT-4 inference pass involves ~1 trillion matrix operations!

# Some Administrivia
- Attendance is not mandatory
- Weekly assignments via canvas
- Assignments are in group of 2,3, or max 4

---

- Some assignments will be peer graded
  - You will grade each others assignment anonymously. 
  - You will not see each others names
  - Group projects are graded intra group based.
- You can change your group before the assignment posted.

---

## Grading

30% assignments  
30% midterm  
40% final  

---

## Letter grades
- $> 90$ or $\approx$ top 10% AA
- $<35$ is FF.
- median $x$, and standard deviation $2s$ (we use half)
  - BA: $\approx[x+3s, x+4s)$ 
  - BB: $\approx[x+2s, x+3s]$ 
  - BC: $\approx[x+1s, x+2s)$ 
  - CC: $\approx[x-1s, x+1s)$ 
  - DC: $\approx[x-2s, x-1s)$ 
  - Depending on the value of $s$ and $x$, some slight changes may occur...

# First Topic: Mathematical Logic 🧠✨

We want to model reality in a way that fits in our heads.  
- **Ideal models** strip away irrelevant details and keep what matters.  

| **Reality** | → | **Model** | → | **Theory** |
|-------------|---|-----------|---|------------|
| Piles of rocks | → | $N = \{0, 1, 2, \dots\}$ | → | $\forall x : \exists y : y = x + 1$ |

---

## What if our model is **too big**? 🤔

**Solution:** Use **axioms** and **inference rules** to build a **theory**.  
- **Axioms:** True statements about the model.  
  - *Example:* "All fish are green."  
- **Inference Rules:** Tools to derive new truths.  
  - *Example:* From "All X are Y" and "Z is X," derive "Z is Y."  
- **Theory:** All statements built from axioms using inference rules.  

---

## Axioms, Models, and Inference Rules 🛠️

**Axioms:**  
- All fish are green.  
- George Washington is a fish.  

**Inference Rule:**  
- From "All X are Y" and "Z is X," derive "Z is Y."  

**Theory:**  
- George Washington is green! 🐟🎩  
  *(Our theory about George, fish, and greenness.)*  

---

### What is a **Model**? 🎯

A **model** is a collection of objects and their relationships.  
- **Theories** describe models.  
- A single theory can have **many models**:  
  - *Example:* A model with green fishy George Washington **and** 900-foot-tall Abraham Lincoln is consistent with the theory above.  
    *(The theory doesn’t mention Abraham Lincoln!)*  

---

### Consistency (Tutarlılık) ⚖️

A theory is **consistent** if it **cannot prove both P and not-P** for any P.  
- **What can go wrong?**  
  - Too many axioms → **Inconsistency**.  
    - *Example:*  
      - All fish are green.  
      - All sharks are not green.  
      - All sharks are fish.  
      - George Washington is a shark.  
      - **Contradiction!** 🚫  

---

### Underconstraining the Model (Modeli Yeterince Sınırlandırmamak) 🎈

If we don’t add enough axioms, the model becomes **underconstrained**.  
- *Example:* Peano axioms for natural numbers.  
  - Axiom: There is a number 0, and any number $x$ has a successor $S(x)$ (think $x + 1$).  
  - Underconstrained model: Only contains 0, where $S(0) = 0$.  

---

## The Language of Logic 🗣️

### Propositional Logic  
- **Basis of mathematical logic.**  
- **Propositions:** Statements that are either **true** or **false**.  
  - *Examples:*  
    - "George Washington is a fish."  
    - "2 + 2 = 5."  

---

### Predicate Logic 🚀  
- **Upgrade from propositional logic** to talk about **objects** and their **properties**.  
- Adds:  
  - **Constants:** Stand-ins for objects (e.g., "George Washington").  
  - **Predicates:** Stand-ins for properties (e.g., "is a fish").
